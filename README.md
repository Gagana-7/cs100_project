## Project Description
 > * Why is it important or interesting to you?

  > This project is interesting to us because a task manager is extremely important and useful in daily life. The task manager can be used to make sure notes and reminders are up to date for any assignments that may need to be completed through the quarter, semester, or even year. In this way we will be able to stay on track and finish any and all assignments while priding ourselves with great time managements skills to allow us to balance our quality of life. In this way we are also able to stay on track with time and work according to a clock which allows us to be more efficient in anything that we intend to accomplish, school or not. 


 > * What languages/tools/technologies do you plan to use? (This list may change over the course of the project)

  > In order to complete these assingments, we as a team are going to use github in order to stay up to date with our project and allow us to collaborate efficiently as group. We will also be using visual studios code in order to code our project efficiently. We will predomininantly be using C++ and Cmake in our code to start off however we could be adding other features which could require us to use other languages as well such as HTML or python. We will also have a database to store tasks. Finally, we will also be using the terminal in order to keep our code up to date with the whole team by pushing and pulling and changes that we have made to github in order to allow other team members to see progress as well. Finally, we will merge the files together to create our final project.


 > * What will be the input/output of your project?

> In order to create the task, the input would be the task the user is trying to complete and the output would be the task being sucessfully created. The inputs would also be the dates and times of the tasks, and what priority they hold for the user while the output would be setting the tasks in order based on their priority and time. 
> In order to remove or delete a task, the user would input the completion of the task and the output would be the removal of the task from the task board.
> In order to see the tasks need to be completed the user would input a command to see the task board and the output would be a notifications to the user informing them of their upcoming tasks, and a interface showcasing the tasks.
> In order to sort a task based on priority a user will indicate how they want the tasks sorted and the ouput would be the way the user chose to sort the tasks.


 > * What are the features that the project provides?

  > The project features such as storing and removing the tasks using the task manager and various commands. It will allow the user to set the tasks in a priority that the user chooses such as time, importance, etc. The user will be able to see all of the tasks which need to be completed in a display form as either a board view or notification system. The task will be formatted with the utmost importance given based on the user priority preference and chronoligical ordering of the tasks. Users will be able to input the name of the task, the level of prioirty, and due date of the task before officially creating the task.


 > ## Phase II
 > In addition to completing the "User Interface Specification" and "Class Diagram" sections below, you will need to:
 > * Create an "Epic" (note) for each feature. Place these epics in the `Product Backlog` column
 > * Complete your first *sprint planning* meeting to plan out the next 7 days of work.
 >   * Break down the "Epics" into smaller actionable user stories (i.e. smaller development tasks). Convert them into issues and assign them to team members. Place these in the `TODO` column (aka Sprint Backlog).
 >   * These cards should represent roughly 7 days worth of development time for your team. Then, once the sprint is over you should be repeating these steps to plan a new sprint, taking you until your second scrum meeting with the reader in phase III.
 > * Schedule two check-ins using Calendly. Both time slots should be during your lab on week 6. Your entire team must be present for both check-ins.
 >   * The first check-in needs to be scheduled with your lab TA. During that meeting, you will discuss your project design/class diagram from phase II.
 >   * The second check-in should be scheduled with a reader. During that meeting you will discuss:
 >     * The tasks you are planning for the first sprint
 >     * How work will be divided between the team members
## User Interface Specification
 > Include a navigation diagram for your screens and the layout of each of those screens as desribed below. For all the layouts/diagrams, you can use any tool such as PowerPoint or a drawing program. (Specification requirement is adapted from the User Interface Design Document Template of CMSC 345 at the University of Maryland Global Campus)

### Navigation Diagram
> Draw a diagram illustrating how the user can navigate from one screen to another. Here is an [example](https://creately.com/diagram/example/ikfqudv82/user-navigation-diagram-classic?r=v). It can be useful to label each symbol that represents a screen so that you can reference the screens in the next section or the rest of the document if necessary. Give a brief description of what the diagram represents.

### Screen Layouts
> Include the layout of each of your screens. The layout should describe the screenâ€™s major components such as menus and prompts for user inputs and expected output, or any graphical user interface components if applicable (e.g. buttons, text boxes, etc). Explain what is on the layout, and the purpose of each menu item, button, etc. If many screens share the same layout, start by describing the general layout and then list the screens that will be using that layout and the differences between each of them.

## Class Diagram
 > Include a **class diagram(s)** for your project and a **description** of the diagram(s). Your class diagram(s) should include all the main classes you plan for the project. This should be in sufficient detail that another group could pick up the project this point and successfully complete it. Use proper UML notation (as discussed in the course slides).
 
 > ## Phase III
 > You will need to schedule a check-in for the second scrum meeting with the same reader you had your first scrum meeting with (using Calendly). Your entire team must be present. This meeting will occur on week 8 during lab time.
 
 > BEFORE the meeting you should do the following:
 > * Update your class diagram from Phase II to include any feedback you received from your TA/grader.
 > * Considering the SOLID design principles, reflect back on your class diagram and think about how you can use the SOLID principles to improve your design. You should then update the README.md file by adding the following:
 >   * A new class diagram incorporating your changes after considering the SOLID principles.
 >   * For each update in your class diagram, you must explain in 3-4 sentences:
 >     * What SOLID principle(s) did you apply?
 >     * How did you apply it? i.e. describe the change.
 >     * How did this change help you write better code?
 > * Perform a new sprint plan like you did in Phase II.
 > * You should also make sure that your README file (and Project board) are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project and the most recent class diagram. Previous versions of the README file should still be visible through your commit history.
 
> During the meeting with your reader you will discuss: 
 > * How effective your last sprint was (each member should talk about what they did)
 > * Any tasks that did not get completed last sprint, and how you took them into consideration for this sprint
 > * Any bugs you've identified and created issues for during the sprint. Do you plan on fixing them in the next sprint or are they lower priority?
 > * What tasks you are planning for this next sprint.

 
 > ## Final deliverable
 > All group members will give a demo to the reader during lab time. ou should schedule your demo on Calendly with the same reader who took your second scrum meeting. The reader will check the demo and the project GitHub repository and ask a few questions to all the team members. 
 > Before the demo, you should do the following:
 > * Complete the sections below (i.e. Screenshots, Installation/Usage, Testing)
 > * Plan one more sprint (that you will not necessarily complete before the end of the quarter). Your In-progress and In-testing columns should be empty (you are not doing more work currently) but your TODO column should have a full sprint plan in it as you have done before. This should include any known bugs (there should be some) or new features you would like to add. These should appear as issues/cards on your Project board.
 > * Make sure your README file and Project board are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project (e.g. any changes that you have made during the project such as changes to your class diagram). Previous versions should still be visible through your commit history. 
 
 ## Screenshots
 > Screenshots of the input/output after running your application
 ## Installation/Usage
 > Instructions on installing and running your application
 ## Testing
 > How was your project tested/validated? If you used CI, you should have a "build passing" badge in this README.
